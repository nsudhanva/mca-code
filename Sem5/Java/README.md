## About

I built this restaurant billing management system as part of my Java coursework for my programming class. The application is built using JavaFX for the UI, OpenCSV to handle importing and exporting order data and Twilio to send order updates to users. This by no means a finished or elegant piece of work, a lot of things were rushed so it could function and be submitted on time ðŸ˜…

## Usage 

Export the project to a runnable jar or run the `Main.java` file in an IDE of your choice (tested on Eclipse).
